# TheUsefulUnit - FriendFinder

Friend Finder is a website that aims to connect people around the activities they love. We, the creators of the website would like to see people meet and bond over their common interests. That is why we have created FriendFinder, a website where you can create events and activites for others to sign up to. If you are looking to meet new friends or simply to gather your friends around an activity you can view a list of activities happening soon and join them. You can even add comments to discuss specifics or express your excitement for it.
